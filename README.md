# PowerShellScripts
PowerShell scripts for System Administration tasks. Grabbed only a handful from work place with FOUO data redacted.

Most of the scripts feature mass pushes using PSexec, winRM, RPC, etc. Uses Active Directory and pinging to verify, and checks prereqs of running machine to make sure it's meeting requirements before initiating any changes.
